The FubuMVC application is defined in the LoggersApplication class.  It's unlikely that you'll

Katana, or Serenity).

configure FubuMVC application settings

* Endpoints for this bottle can be configured in NLogRegistry
* Globally applied policies and services can be added in
  NLogExtensions
* You may need to run 'rake compile' to build out the pak-*.zip files
  before the code will compile
